	The purpose of this file is to be a lightweight landing page for standard
	forms that will redirect to the JS searcher using a #!term thing.

	Since the JS searcher is a heavyweight page (it includes the search index
	inline so it doesn't have to XHR, which would break on file:// urls), we
	want it to be cached. Normal ?query urls would bust the cache. I don't mind
	busting the cache on this little file, but we really want to avoid that on
	the big index file.

	Hence, the redirect hack.

		<p>The "offline" searcher requires Javascript.</p>
		<p>To get search without JS, build the `locate.d` file (see the adrdox makefile) and use it as a CGI program on a regular web server, or build with -version=embedded_httpd to embed its own server and run that.</p>
		<p>Then, configure the server to call that script instead of loading this file, or change your skeleton.html search form action to point to it.</p>
